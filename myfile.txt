Schrodinger’s Wave equation  
The moving particle is described by a wave function and there is a need to have a wave equation 
which can describe this moving particle. Schrodinger’s approach to describe the motion in terms of a 
differential equation is one of the most popular methods. (Dirac’s operator mechanics with vector 
spaces is another method of describing the moving particle and is a computational friendly method.)  
The one dimensional time dependent Schrodinger’s wave equation  
The most general met hod of describing a system involves evaluating the system in terms of the state 
variables of position and time.  
The total energy of a system is equal to the sum of kinetic energy and potential energy  (which are 
observables of the system)  
The energy express ion can be written as    E = KE + V  
Multiplying throughout with  the wave function  ψ   we get     
𝑬𝝍(𝒙,𝒕)=𝑲𝑬𝝍 (𝒙,𝒕)+𝑽𝝍(𝒙,𝒕)                          ……… (1)  
This equation can be written in terms of the corresponding operators as  
                                             𝑬̂𝝍(𝒙,𝒕)=𝑲𝑬̂𝝍(𝒙,𝒕)+𝑽𝝍(𝒙,𝒕)      
which is an eigen value equation for the total 
energy of the system.  
The total energy operator is {𝑖ℏ𝜕
𝜕𝑡}, the 
kinetic energy operator is {−ℏ2
2𝑚𝜕2
𝜕𝑥2}.   
replacing the total energy and the kinetic 
energy terms with the respective operators 
we can rewrite the expression (1) as  
𝒊ℏ𝝏𝝍
𝝏𝒕= −ℏ𝟐
𝟐𝒎𝝏𝟐𝝍
𝝏𝒙𝟐+𝑽𝝍

𝝏𝒙𝟐+𝒊ℏ𝝏𝚿
𝝏𝒕−𝑽𝚿=𝟎   ….(2)  
which is the Schrödinger’s time dependent wave function since Ψ(x,t) is a function of both position 
and time.  
The solution of the differential equation yields the wave function  𝚿 which is the state function of the 
system.  
The one dimensional time independent Schrodinger’s wave equation  
Generally any  system in the steady state   is time invariant and hence the wave function could be 
independent of time.  In such a case we can write the wave function can be written as the product of 
two functions one that is position dependent and the other time dependent.  
Ie.,  Ψ(𝑥,𝑡)= 𝐴𝑒𝑖
ℏ(𝑝𝑥).𝑒−𝑖
ℏ(𝐸𝑡)= 𝜓(𝑥) .𝜙(𝑡) 
where 𝜓(𝑥)= 𝐴𝑒𝑖
ℏ(𝑝𝑥)  is the position dependent part and   𝜙(𝑡)=𝑒−𝑖
ℏ(𝐸𝑡) is the time dependent part.  
Substituting Ψ(𝑥,𝑡)= 𝜓(𝑥) .𝜙(𝑡) in equation (2 ) we get   
ℏ2
2𝑚𝜕2𝜓(𝑥).𝜙(𝑡)
𝜕𝑥2                +𝑖ℏ𝜕𝜓(𝑥).𝜙(𝑡)
𝜕𝑡                 −𝑉𝜓(𝑥).𝜙(𝑡)=0   
The total energy E of the steady state system being a constant, the total energy operator can be 
replaced by the value E with no loss of sense.

This is the Schrödinger’s time independent one dimensional wave equation. The solutions of the 
Schrodinger’s wave equation yield the wave function  𝜓(𝑥) which  describes the physical state of the 
system.  
The solution so obtained has to be checked for continuities at any boundaries and normalized  to get 
the exact wave function of the system.

[Three dimensional Schrodinger’s wave equation . 
The Schrodinger’s wave equation for a 3D can be evolved by looking at the problem as three one 
dimensional problem in the independent variables x,y and z. The wave function of such a system can 
be written as  
Ψ(𝑥,𝑦,𝑧)= 𝜓(𝑥)𝜓(𝑦)𝜓(𝑧)  where 𝜓(𝑥),𝜓(𝑦) 𝑎𝑛𝑑  𝜓(𝑧) are the three mutually independent wave 
functions of the particles in the orthogonal co -ordinate system.  
The derivatives of the wave function can be written as partial derivatives of the wave function . 
The SWE then can be written as

𝜕𝑥2  +𝜕2

  which can be simplified as  
ℏ2

where   ∇2=(𝜕2

The wave function 𝜓(𝑥) which is the solution of the differential equation ℏ2
2md2ψ(x).
dx2+Eψ(x) −Vψ(x)=
0   is a state function.  Since a system could have multiple states the solution of the wave equation 
can give us multiple   wave  functions  𝜓(𝑥).  If   𝜓1(𝑥) represents a state 1 andf   𝜓2(𝑥) represents a 
state 2 of the system then it can be seen that a linear  combination of   𝜓1(𝑥) and 𝜓2(𝑥) is also a 
solution of the SWE. Thus 𝜓12(𝑥)=n.𝜓1(𝑥) +m.𝜓2(𝑥) will also be a solution of the SWE.  It is 
obvious that the superposition of two waves is a wave packet and can represent the state of a 
system.  
It is also evident  that the probability densities however do not add to give the probability density of the 
new state and has to be estimated from the new wave function    ] Quantum Mechanics of Simple systems  Unit II                                202 1

Template for solving problems in quantum mechanics using the Schrödinger’s wave equation  
The Schrodinger’s wave equation can be applied to any physical system and the solution of the wave 
equation yields the wave function of the system. The wave function i s probability  amplitude and 
contains information about the physical state (observables of the system). The wave function has to 
be a well behaved wave function  to represent a moving particle . 
The template for solving the Schrodinger’s wave equation is:  
1. Define / set up the physical system (define particle nature, boundaries of potential, total 
energy of the particle etc)  
 
2. Write the Schrodinger’s wave equation and apply the known conditions  
 
3. Obtain the general form of the wave function  
 
4. Check / verify the wav e function for it’s characteristics  
• finiteness, discreteness and continuity of 𝜓 𝑎𝑛𝑑  𝑖𝑡𝑠 𝑑𝑒𝑟𝑖𝑣𝑎𝑡𝑖𝑣𝑒𝑠 , 
• normalization of the wave functions  
 
5. Interpret  the solution and get the implications on the quantum system.  
 
 
Problem no 1.  Free Particle solution  
A particle is said to be a free particle when it experiences no external forces.  
Thus the force given by   𝐹=−𝑑𝑉
𝑑𝑥=0.  This implies that either V  is zero or V  is a constant.   
The simplest case then could be when the particle is moving in a region of zero  potential i.e., V=0.  
The Schrödinger’s time independent one dimensional wave equation  for the system simplifies to  
ℏ2
2𝑚𝑑2𝜓(𝑥).
𝑑𝑥2+𝐸𝜓(𝑥) =0    or   𝑑2𝜓(𝑥).
𝑑𝑥2+2𝑚
ℏ2𝐸𝜓=0   
𝒅𝟐𝝍(𝒙).
𝒅𝒙𝟐+𝒌𝟐𝝍=𝟎  where 𝒌=√𝟐𝒎𝑬
ℏ𝟐  is the propagation constant.  
The solution of this differential equation is     𝝍=𝑨𝒆𝒊𝒌𝒙 +𝑩𝒆−𝒊𝒌𝒙   where A and B are constants.  
As a general concept the first part describes a forward moving wave packet (in increasing x direction) 
and the second part describes a backward moving wave packet (decreasing x direction)  
The energy of the particle is given by   𝑬= ℏ𝟐𝒌𝟐
𝟐𝒎 . 
Since the free particle is moving in a zero potential region and there is no restriction on wave number 
or the energy of the particle, we conclude that the total energy of the particle is kinetic in nature  with 
no implications of quantization.  
This could the quantum des cription of a classical free particle.  
Energy interaction of particles with fields  
Consider a simple arrangement of two highly conducting hollow tubes 
perfectly aligned along the axes and electrically separated by an

extremely small distance.    Let the fir st tube be 
connected to ground so that the potential on 
the surface of the tube is V=0.  
The second tube is connected to a constant 
potential V=V o with respect to ground.  
Consider a particle with energy E incident along 
the axis of the first tube. Since the potential on 
the surface of the tube is zero,  there is no effect on the particle’s motion inside the first segment. As 
the particle leaves the first segment and tries to  enter the second segment, there is a forward 
acceleration (deceleration) of the particle  as it enters the second segment. Once inside the second 
segment the radial forces on the particle add up to zero and the particle continues to move through 
the segmen t with energy 𝑬±𝑽. We treat this as an interaction of the particle with the field where it 
has gained (or lost) energy with the potential field.  
As the particle reaches the end of the second segment, the interaction is reversed. The particle can 
now be d ecelerated (or accelerated) which results in the particle giving away the energy it gained (or 
lost) back to the field.  
This experiment reveals two aspects – a particle moving in force fields where the forces are zero 
since 𝒅𝑽
𝒅𝒙 is zero in both segment s of the tube. However, there can be an exchange of energy with the 
field as the particle  enters or as the particle leaves the second part of tube where there exists a 
constant potential .   
Thus,  in general it can be concluded that a particle moving in a f ield can interact with the field and 
exchange energy with the field at the boundaries. This concept is quite useful in understanding the 
particle’s motion in a field.  
Problem no. 2 -  Potential Steps  
The behavior of a moving particle when it encounters a potential field along its path is the first step in 
solving problems in Quantum Mechanics.  In reality the potential field varies inversely as the distance 
from the source of the potential ( i.𝑒.,𝑉∝1
𝑟). However , the solution of the Schrödinger’s wave equation 
becomes difficult if the actual potential variations are considered.  It is therefore necessary and 
sufficient if the potentials are approximated to simpler (solvable)  systems.   
This leads to the concept of potential steps where the potential energy vs. 
distance graphs show a discrete jump from a zero value to a constant 
value V 0.  However the behavior of the wave function  (representing the 
particle) can have different responses depending on the energy of the 
particle as compared to the energy of the potential step. The energy of the 
particle can be greater or less than the energy of the potential step.     
 
The problem can be divided as a two region problem, region I in which the 
potential V=0 and the region II in which the potential V= V 0.   
The Schrödinger’s  wave equation     𝜕2𝜓
𝜕𝑥2+2𝑚
ℏ2(𝐸−𝑉)𝜓=0     
for the region I with V=0 this becomes    𝜕2𝜓
𝜕𝑥2+2𝑚
ℏ2𝐸𝜓=0 
The solution of the equation in region I is given by    
𝜓1=𝐴𝑒𝑖𝑘1𝑥 +𝐵𝑒−𝑖𝑘1𝑥

where 𝑘1=√2𝑚𝐸
ℏ2 and the debroglie wavelength  𝜆1=ℎ
√2𝑚𝐸 
The component with the positive exponent represents the oncoming wave and the negative exponent 
represents the reflected wave at the boundary x=0  
In region II the nature of the wave function will depend on the energy E of the particle in comparison 
to the energy of the potential step.  
Case I .  If the energy E of the particle is greater than the energy of the potential (E>V o) step then the 
Schrödinger’s wave  equation  for the region II can  be written as   
 𝝏𝟐𝝍𝑰𝑰
𝝏𝒙𝟐+𝟐𝒎
ℏ𝟐(𝑬−𝑽𝒐)𝝍𝑰𝑰=𝟎  
with the solution being    𝜓𝐼𝐼=𝐶𝑒−𝑖𝑘𝐼𝐼𝑥+𝐷𝑒𝑖𝑘𝐼𝐼𝑥  where 𝒌𝑰𝑰=√𝟐𝒎(𝑬−𝑽𝒐)
ℏ𝟐.  The nature of the wave  
function remains the cyclic  and the particle propagates  in region II 
with reduced kinetic energy ( E-Vo.). The first term of the wave 
function is non existing since there cannot be a reflection after x>0 
as there is no disruption in the potential.   
The momentum in the second region is given by  
 ℏ𝒌𝑰𝑰= √𝟐𝒎(𝑬−𝑽𝒐)  and the corresponding debroglie 
wavelength 𝝀𝑰𝑰=𝒉
√𝟐𝒎(𝑬−𝑽𝒐)  which is longer than the debroglie 
wavelength in region I . 
In this case the constants B and D can be found in terms of A by applying the boundary condition that 
the wave  function and its derivatives are finite and continuous at x = 0.  
𝒂𝒕 𝒙=𝟎     𝝍𝑰(𝒙=𝟎)=𝝍𝑰𝑰(𝒙=𝟎) 𝒈𝒊𝒗𝒆𝒔  𝑨+𝑩=𝑫 
𝒂𝒕 𝒙=𝟎     𝒅𝝍 𝑰(𝒙=𝟎)=𝒅𝝍 𝑰𝑰(𝒙=𝟎) 𝒈𝒊𝒗𝒆𝒔  (𝑨−𝑩)𝒌𝑰=𝑫𝒌𝑰𝑰 
Solving the simultaneous equations we get  𝑫=𝟐𝑨∗(𝒌𝑰
𝒌𝑰 𝒂𝒏𝒅   𝒌𝑰𝑰) 
𝑫=𝟐𝑨∗(𝒌𝑰
𝒌𝑰+𝒌𝑰𝑰) and   𝑩=𝑨∗(𝒌𝑰− 𝒌𝑰𝑰
𝒌𝑰+𝒌𝑰𝑰) 
It is seen that the coefficient B of the reflected component is non zero  implying that there is a small 
probability  of reflection at x=0 even if the energy of the particle is greater than the potential step V o. 
The flux of incident particles is given by     𝝍𝟏∗𝝍𝟏×𝒗𝟏= 𝑨∗𝑨 𝒗𝟏   
The reflection coefficient can be written as 𝑹= 𝒓𝒆𝒇𝒍𝒆𝒄𝒕𝒆𝒅  𝒇𝒍𝒖𝒙
𝒊𝒏𝒄𝒊𝒅𝒆𝒏𝒕  𝒇𝒍𝒖𝒙 =𝑩∗𝑩 𝒗𝟏
𝑨∗𝑨 𝒗𝟏= (𝒌𝑰− 𝒌𝑰𝑰
𝒌𝑰+𝒌𝑰𝑰)2
  
and the transmission coefficient 𝑻= 𝒕𝒓𝒂𝒏𝒔𝒎𝒊𝒕𝒕𝒆𝒅  𝒇𝒍𝒖𝒙
𝒊𝒏𝒄𝒊𝒅𝒆𝒏𝒕  𝒇𝒍𝒖𝒙 =𝑫∗𝑫 𝒗𝑰𝑰
𝑨∗𝑨 𝒗𝑰  where 𝒗𝑰 and 𝒗𝑰𝑰 are the velocities of 
the particles in the two regions.  
Thus, the transmission co -efficient T = (𝟒𝒌𝑰.𝒌𝑰𝑰
𝒌𝑰+𝒌𝑰𝑰)=𝟒√𝑬.(𝑬−𝑽𝒐)
(√𝑬+√𝑬−𝑽𝒐 )𝟐 
It is observed that R+T = 1, i.e. the flux incident has to be partially reflected and partially transmitted.

R and T are the relative probabilities of reflection and transmission at the potential step.  
 
Case II  Energy of the particle < V o. 
In region I the behavior of the particle is the same at the previous case (since V=0) and the wave 
function will be  
𝜓1=𝐴𝑒𝑖𝑘1𝑥 +𝐵𝑒−𝑖𝑘1𝑥 
If the energy E of the particle is lesser than the energy of the potential step  (E<Vo), then  the 
Schrödinger’s wave equation for the region II can be written as   
  𝝏𝟐𝝍𝟐
𝝏𝒙𝟐−𝟐𝒎
ℏ𝟐(𝑽𝒐−𝑬)𝝍𝟐=𝟎  
with the solution being    𝝍𝟐=𝑭𝒆−𝜶𝒙+𝐺𝒆𝜶𝒙   where 𝜶=√𝟐𝒎(𝑽𝒐−𝑬)
ℏ𝟐 
The second part of the wave function 𝐺𝒆𝜶𝒙 , makes   𝝍𝟐 infinite for large values 
of x and hence cannot be part of the wave function.  Setting  the coefficient G to 
be zero the wave function reduces to  
𝝍𝟐=𝑭𝒆−𝜶𝒙  
The wave function  has a finite value and decays exponentia lly in region II.  
Thus there exists a finite probability  for the particle to be found in region II 
( 𝑠𝑖𝑛𝑐𝑒   𝝍𝟐∗𝝍𝟐 𝑖𝑠 𝑛𝑜𝑛  𝑧𝑒𝑟𝑜 )  which i s unlike the classical solution . 
(In an exponential decay the wave function is significant till it decays to  1
𝑒  of the  value at x=0. At x=0 
the value of the function   𝝍𝟐=𝑭. The changes in this function  𝝍𝟐=𝑭𝒆−𝜶𝒙 become insignificant at 
some   ∆𝒙.  
The function  evaluated at  ∆𝒙  gives   𝝍𝟐(∆𝒙)=𝑭𝒆−𝜶∆𝒙=𝑭∗𝟏
𝒆=𝑭∗𝒆−𝟏. 
This implies   𝜶∗∆𝒙=𝟏  or  ∆𝒙=𝟏
𝜶=ℏ
√𝟐𝒎(𝑽𝒐−𝑬) ).  
The wave function becomes insignificant  at a distance  ∆𝒙=ℏ
√𝟐𝒎(𝑽𝒐−𝑬)  which is the penetration depth 
in region II.  The penetration depth increases as the energy of the particle increases.  
In the second region the kinetic energy of the particle is negative which implies that the particle 
cannot physically exist in the second region.   
We conclude that when a particle ( or beam of particles with identical E) is incident on a potential step, 
there is a quantum mechanical effect which - 
• the particle can be reflected back even if the energy of the particle E > V o. 
• the particle can have a small but finite probability of being  in the second region even if E<V o. 
Problem no. 3 -  Potential Barrier

A particle  of mass m and  energy E < V o, incident on the potential barrier is represented by a forward 
moving wave.  Since E < Vo classically  we expect the particle to be reflected back at the potential 
barrier  and there is no probability of finding the particle in the region beyond the barrier . 
In region I with V=0 the Schrödinger’s  wave equation becomes   𝝏𝟐𝝍𝑰

The first term in equation 2 represents the incident wave and the second term represents the

where v1 and v3 are the velocities of the particle in region I and III.   Since 
the energy of the particle is the same in the two regions the velocities are 
also same and   
the transmission coefficient can be evaluated approximately as

Thus the probability  of transmission is more if  either 𝜶 or a is small . Smaller  𝜶 implies smaller   (𝑉𝑜−
𝐸). Thus particles with higher energy have higher  transmission  probability through the barrier .  
If the width of the barrier L is less than the penetration depth ∆𝒙  then there is a finite probability 
that the particle is transmitted across the barrier . 
This process of transmission through a potential barrier even when the energy of the particle is lesser 
than the barrier potential is known as barrier tunneling  or the quantum mechanical tunneling . 
It is also noted that for all values of E, there is always a reflected component which is given by  R =  1 
– T which is higher than the transmitted coefficient.  
[The particle in the second region has a negative Kinetic energy and this is not a physical reality.  
However, the particle can exchange energies with the field (potential) without violating the uncertainty

4𝜋.  Thus the energy exchange  has to happen  in a time interval of   ∆𝑡 =ℎ
4𝜋∆𝐸. This 
gives a time interval which is extremely small of the order of femto seconds. Thus , the particle has to 
cross the barrier almost instantaneously]      
Radioactive alpha decay as a case of barrier tunneling  
Emission of alpha  particles ( Helium nuclei ) in the decay of 
radioactive elements  can be  example of tunneling . 
The positive charge on the nucleus creates a nonlinear  potential  
barrier around the nucleus . This potential barrier is estimated to 
be as high as 20MeV at the surface.  
In the radioactive α decay of the nucleus , two  protons and two 
neutrons are emitted as  a single entity  (a doubly charged He 
nucleus). The process of radioactive  decay of α particles  with 
low energies compared to the barrier potential could be 
explained as a case of barrier tunneling.  
The potential which varies inversely as the distance from  the surface 
of the nucleus can be approximated to a triangular potential. This 
can then be modeled as a series of rectangular potentials of thin 
slices of thickness   ∆𝑟. The potential barrier for each of these slices 
decrease by a small   ∆𝑉, which gives  𝜶𝒏=√𝟐𝒎(𝑽𝒏−𝑬)
ℏ𝟐 
The transmission coefficients for each of the slice of potential barrier 
can be evaluated  with  𝑻𝒏=𝒆−𝟐𝜶𝒏∆𝒓  and the total transmission 
probability is the product of all these individual transmission 
probabilities. This gives a reasonable  
estimate  of the tunneling probabilities  of alpha particles.   
Tunneling rate is very sensitive to s mall changes in energy and  size of the nucleus and account  for 
the wide range of decay times  to different radioactive  nuclei.   
Taking t he alpha particles to be in a state of constant motion with a very high kinetic energy, the 
frequency of approach to the nuclear surface can be est imated to be the diameter of the nucleus 
divided by the velocity of the particles. This frequency when multiplied by the transmission co -efficient 
gives us the probability that an alpha particle is emitted out of the nucleus.  The inverse of this 
probabili ty is then the mean lifetime  for alpha decay of the radioactive nucleus.

A particle  with mass m and energy E is confined in a one dimensional box  with infinite potential at the

Particle in a 2D well of infinite potential at the boundaries  
A particle in a two dimensional well has two degrees of freedom and can 
move in XY plane.  This can be treated as a case of particle confined in

The momentum P of a particle moving in the x y plane  can be resolved 
into two independent momentum  components Px and Py along the x and

The second allowed state of the system is given by 𝐸21=5𝐸𝑜 which is also the energy of the 
state   𝐸12.  The re are two allowed states for the same energy value of  5𝐸𝑜.  This state is then doubly 
degenerate.  
In general , for a 2D system in when 𝑛 𝑥= 𝑛𝑦 the energy state is a single  state and when 𝑛 𝑥≠ 𝑛𝑦 
the energy state has a degeneracy factor of 2.

The states have a degeneracy factor of 3 whenever two of the numbers 𝑛 𝑥,   𝑛𝑦 𝑎𝑛𝑑   𝑛𝑧   are equal

Problem no. 5 -  Finite potential well  
The finite potential well is a closer approximation to real potentials in 
solids .  The particle can be confined to a region with constant potential 
VO at the walls   |𝑥|>𝐿
2 .. Inside the potential well region of –L/2 to +L/2 
the potential is zero.   In this case the SWE for the three regions can be 
solved to get the nature of the wave functions . 
However,  these do not result in  an exact solution and approximation  
methods are used.   The nature of the wave  functions  in the  three 
regions can be written as  
𝝍𝟏=𝑫𝒆𝜶𝒙   where 𝜶=√𝟐𝒎(𝑽𝒐−𝑬)
ℏ𝟐  for the region x<   −𝐿2⁄

The cosine solutions  show  even parity (symmetric when sign of the 
function becomes negative ) and  the sine solutions e xhibit  odd parity  (anti

be noted that the wave function 𝝍𝟐 would not be zero at the boundaries of

for n=2  
It can be seen that the right-hand  side and left-hand  
side of the equations contain the same variable E and 
the nature of  variations of  the functions on either sides 
are quite different and hence an exact solution do not 
exist.  (Equations of this type are  called transcendental 
equations.)  
The energy values of the particle inside the well region can be found from graphical or approximate 
methods.  The variation of the left-hand  side and the right-hand  side could be plotted on the same 
graph as a function . The points of intersection of the LHS and RHS plots are the solutions as the 
values of E satisfy both the equations.  
Thus , the different energy states could be evaluated.

Since the particle is in t he finite potential well , at least one solution to the problem exists. Or one 
energy state exists  for the particle in the finite potential well. The number of solutions would obviously 
depend on the height of the finite potential V o.  
From the expression for the energy of an infinite potential well we can write the energy of the particle 
in a finite potential well as  
𝑬𝒊𝒏𝒇𝒊𝒏𝒊𝒕𝒆 =ℏ𝟐𝝅𝟐𝒏𝟐
𝟐𝒎𝑳𝟐=ℏ𝟐𝒏𝟐
𝟐𝒎(𝒘𝒊𝒅𝒕𝒉  𝒐𝒇 𝒕𝒉𝒆 𝒘𝒆𝒍𝒍  𝒘𝒉𝒆𝒓𝒆  𝝍→𝟎)𝟐 
In the case of the finite potential well we can define the effective width of the well as the points where 
the wave function  becomes insignificant. Thus,  the effective width of the well is the width of the well 
plus twice the penetration depth of the particle in that ene rgy state.   The penetration depths in the 
regions of the potential V o is given by 𝚫𝒙= 𝒉
√𝟐𝒎(𝑽𝒐−𝑬𝒙)  which is a function of Ex.  
The effective width of the box (defined approx  as the points at the wave function becomes 
insignificant of zero) is then larger and can be approximated as L+2 ∆𝑥 
In the case of the finite potential well the energy of the particle can be written as  
𝑬𝒇𝒊𝒏𝒊𝒕𝒆 =ℏ𝟐𝝅𝟐𝒏𝟐
𝟐𝒎(𝒘𝒊𝒅𝒕 𝒉 𝒐𝒇 𝒕𝒉𝒆 𝒘𝒆𝒍𝒍  𝒘𝒉𝒆𝒓𝒆 𝝍→𝟎)𝟐=ℏ𝟐𝝅𝟐𝒏𝟐

Hence the energy values are less than the energy values for the corresponding states of a n infinite 
potential well of the width  L.  
Problem no. 6 - Harmonic Oscillator  
Harmonic oscillator is one of the most fundamental systems in quantum 
mechanics which gives insight to a variety of problems such as the 
vibrational molecular spectroscopy.   
The classical harmonic oscillator is a bound particle subjected to oscillations

Consider a diatomic molecule with the masses of the atoms as m 1 and 
m2 bound by a bond that is springy in nature. This can be studied as a 
spring mass system with spring constant (which basically depend on the 
bond strength). In this case the effective mas s 𝛍 of the system will

The wave functions of the system can be graphically inferred  
by considering each of the states to be equivalent t o a one-
dimensional  finite potential well . The width of the well 
corresponds to the maximum displacement in that state . 
Therefore , the wave functions of the finite potential well that we 
inferred are useful even in this c ase. However, each state has 
an increasing width and the tails of the decaying wave 
functions also increase as the energy of the state increases.  The probability distribution functions for 
the first few states are also shown in the figure.  
The real potential energy variations deviate f rom the ideal parabolic potential energy curve. The 
bonding results in exchange of electrons / sharing of electrons resulting in a deviation of the 
electrostatic interactions. The deviation is treated as a perturbation of the harmonic oscillator potential 
with an addition term for the potential.  
The result of this variation  results in energy levels which are 
not uniformly distributed and the separation between the 
energy levels decrease for larger values of n. 
This analysis helps  us understand the vibration  energy states 
of a diatomic molecule and forms the fundamental analysis of 
the Infra Red absorption by the molecular.  This analysis can 
be extended to understand the vibrational states of lattices in a 
crystal which leads to the concept of phonons in cry stals.

Problem 7: Discussion of the solutions to the Hydrogen atom problem.  
The hydrogen atom is the simplest possible stable atom with one proton in 
the nucleus and one   electron in the orbital. In the ground state, the system 
exhibits perfect spherical symmetry. Hence the possibility of looking for a 
solution to the Schrodinger’s wave equation for the states of the electron 
could be attempted. Though the problem looks ve ry simple as a case of only 
two particles, the mathematical analysis of the solutions is very exhaustive.  
The methodology and the solutions are discussed to present a picture of how 
the quantum numbers of a system evolves out naturally from the solution of 
the differential equation in three dimensions.

Since the hydrogen atom exhibits a spherical symmetry it is prudent to 
write the Schrodinger’s wave equation in the spherical co -ordinate 
system (𝒓,𝜽,𝜑).

[Particle  in a Box with infinite potenti als at the walls (boundaries at

A particle in an  one dimensional box is confined to be within the 
boundaries (x=0 and x=L) where the potential tends to infinity. The 
particle cannot be found outside the boundary x<0 and X>L.  The 
potential inside the well V=0.

𝜕𝑥2+𝑘2𝜓=0 where 𝑘=√2𝑚𝐸
ℏ2 
The solution of the equation in region 0<x<L  is given by  
𝜓(𝑥)=𝐴𝑠𝑖𝑛 (𝑘𝑥)+𝐵𝑐𝑜𝑠 (𝑘𝑥) 
Applying the boundary condition tha t 𝜓=0 𝑎𝑡 𝑥=0 𝑎𝑛𝑑  𝑥=𝐿   
At x=0   𝜓(𝑥=0)=𝐴𝑠𝑖𝑛 (𝑘0)+𝐵𝑐𝑜𝑠 (𝑘0)= 0  𝑔𝑖𝑣𝑒𝑠  𝐵=0 
The wave function then reduces to 𝜓(𝑥)=𝐴𝑠𝑖𝑛 (𝑘𝑥) 
At x=L   𝜓(𝐿)=𝐴𝑠𝑖𝑛 (𝑘𝐿)=0 . 
If A=0 the wave function does not exist and hence 𝑘𝐿=𝑛𝜋 
Or  𝑘=𝑛.𝜋
𝐿 , thus propagation constant can be only multiples of 𝜋
𝐿 
This also gives us the energy 𝐸𝑛=ℏ2𝑛2

The wave function then reduces to 𝜓(𝑥)=𝐴𝑠𝑖𝑛 (𝑛𝜋

The constant A can be evaluated by normalizing the wave function ie., ∫𝜓∗𝜓𝐿

∫[𝐴𝑠𝑖𝑛 (𝑛𝜋

This gives a value of 𝐴=√2
